# fAffirmation Envelope Website

Welcome to the **Affirmation Envelope**! This is a simple and interactive website where users can hover over or touch an envelope to reveal a random affirmation. It's designed to bring positivity and inspiration with just a click or tap.



## Features

- **Interactive Envelope**: Hover over or touch the envelope to reveal a random affirmation.
- **Random Affirmations**: A collection of uplifting affirmations is displayed each time.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean and visually appealing interface.



## How It Works

1. **Hover or Touch**: When the user hovers over (on desktop) or touches (on mobile) the envelope, it "opens" to reveal a random affirmation.
2. **Affirmation Display**: A new affirmation is displayed each time the envelope is interacted with.
3. **Reset**: The envelope closes when the user stops hovering or moves away, ready for the next interaction.
